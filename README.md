### Development Principles

We strive to provide a basic starter project based on:
- MVVM as presented in [Architecting Flutter apps](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture)
- the usage of pub.dev packages preferably found in [Flutter Favorite](https://pub.dev/packages?q=is%3Aflutter-favorite).
- pub.dev packages not in he Flutter Favorite program should be mature, well maintaned and in general usage.
